# Third-Party Notices

Distribution note: This personal skill bundles only the fixed map templates, not the legacy Boundary Library described below. The upstream notices are retained for attribution and provenance context. No boundary data was refreshed for this release.

The MIT License in `LICENSE` covers only original project code and original project assets. The geographic data below remains governed by its own source license.

The bundled Boundary Library is retained only for advanced/legacy maintenance and reference workflows. The current ordinary map path uses the ten fixed templates in `assets/maps/templates/manifest.json`; neither that Builder nor the ordinary page reads or renders these Boundary files. Keeping the files in this repository still requires the source and license notices below.

## Country boundaries

- Source: [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) data distributed through [`datasets/geo-countries`](https://github.com/datasets/geo-countries).
- License: Natural Earth states that its map data is [public domain](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/terms-of-use/). The data package and its transformations are distributed under [Open Data Commons PDDL 1.0](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1-0/).
- Attribution: Natural Earth and `datasets/geo-countries`.
- Repository changes: The aggregate country dataset was reduced to the selected countries and serialized as one GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` per country.
- Provenance note: `scripts/sync-boundaries.mjs` currently references the mutable `main` branch. The exact revision represented by the checked-in snapshot was not recorded and must be confirmed or pinned by a maintainer before the data is refreshed or represented as a reproducible release.

## China provincial boundaries

- Source: the pinned [`geoBoundaries` `gbOpen` CHN ADM1 simplified release](https://github.com/wmgeolab/geoBoundaries/tree/9469f09/releaseData/gbOpen/CHN/ADM1). The corresponding [CHN ADM1 API metadata](https://www.geoboundaries.org/api/current/gbOpen/CHN/ADM1/) names geoBoundaries and Wikimedia Commons as sources.
- License: The layer metadata reports the individual upstream data as Public Domain. The [geoBoundaries project license](https://github.com/wmgeolab/geoBoundaries/blob/main/LICENSE) applies CC BY 4.0 to project code and derivative works while stating that individual Boundary files remain governed by their own metadata. geoBoundaries attribution is retained accordingly.
- Attribution: geoBoundaries at William & Mary, plus the upstream source identified by the release metadata.
- Repository changes: The simplified ADM1 collection was split into individual GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` files and given normalized local filenames; the geometry was not redrawn.
- Provenance note: The downloaded metadata exposes only the generic `commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File` value for the upstream Wikimedia source. A maintainer must confirm the exact Wikimedia file URL before claiming more specific upstream provenance.

## Major-city boundaries

- Source: [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) data returned by the public [Nominatim service](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/).
- License: [Open Database License 1.0 (ODbL-1.0)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/).
- Attribution: © OpenStreetMap contributors.
- Repository changes: Results for a fixed list of cities were cached and serialized as one administrative-boundary GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` per city. Returned `osm_type` and `osm_id` values remain in each feature's properties.
- Provenance note: The exact retrieval date and OpenStreetMap database snapshot were not recorded. A maintainer must record them when these cached files are refreshed.

Source and license review is a maintainer task whenever Boundary Library files are added, refreshed, or prepared for a public release. Ordinary trip generation must not use or refresh this library.
